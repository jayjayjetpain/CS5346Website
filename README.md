# Dallas Apartment Website - SMU CS5346 Cloud Computing Project 

## Information About the Website
This is the semester project is for our CS 5346 - Cloud Computing Class at SMU created by Jayson Werth (<https://github.com/jayjayjetpain>) and Isaac Rose (<https://github.com/itrose225>). We were tasked with creating an application and deplying it to the cloud with specific requirements.

Overarching Goal: To successfully host your software in the cloud, leveraging multiple cloud offerings in the process, and present your experiences (demonstrate your software, discuss your choices, explain your rationale and considerations, etc.) to the class as if presenting to a potential employer. We all get to benefit from learning about one anotherâ€™s project, and I want your project to be meaningful to you.

Project Description: This is a one stop shop for Dallas apartment shoppers. We provide competitive, viable, and financially realistic apartments for those looking for housing. In addition, we offer pricing predictions using our proprietary technology to give you a future outlook into how prices may change. So whether you are looking for an affordable apartment now or in 6 months, we have got you covered.
